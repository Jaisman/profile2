        <p id="sec">It's a thing.Have you had one?I don't get them often, but when I do...wow...watch out wallet!
            At the moment it's bright and bold and perfect for the print clashing fashions of now. <br>
            And then perfect for when you're feeling more monochrome too. These babies pack a punch. I'm loving them for all the punches. All. And yes, I have a thing for cross body and cute handles. Here's the bright designer bags I'm currently crushing on:
            DOLCE & GABBANA  mini 'Sicily' iPhone bag -  so so tiny, but oh so mighty! The hydrangea's had me at hello. I'd wear this with black or white, sundress or suit. Just so darling and fun! <br>
            DOLCE & GABBANA  medium Sicily bag - what heaven is this? It's essentially a millennial pink-cheeked, sophisticated lady with a little sass. She who carries this is getting what she wants without hurting anyone in the process. I LOVE her. <br>
            DOLCE & GABBANA  Lucia shoulder bag - ok there's more than just Dolce in this wishlist I promise...but clearly they have a good thing going. This is everything I want my Italian tour of art and history and flavour and architecture to be: loud. <br>
